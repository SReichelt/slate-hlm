/**
 * @remarks This definition is a slight extension of `$restriction` that simultaneously extends the codomain to a superset `B` of `Y`.
 *
 *          It might seem tempting to remove the need for this definition by implicitly treating a function to `Y` as a function to a superset `B` of `Y`, without explicitly specifying `B`. However, this could lead to confusion as the resulting function may not be surjective even though the original function is.
