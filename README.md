# The Slate interactive theorem prover

Slate is an interactive theorem prover that is currently under development.
This repository contains its standard library.

## Web access

Slate is designed as a web application; most library changes should eventually be made using the web interface: https://sreichelt.github.io/slate/.

The web interface automatically creates personal forks of this repository for each contributor, and sends submissions as pull requests.

## Local development

The Slate repository contains the library as a Git submodule. Therefore, when running Slate locally as described at https://github.com/SReichelt/slate#readme, the library can be edited directly. To submit local changes, you will need to point the Git remote at your own fork.
