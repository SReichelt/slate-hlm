# The Slate interactive theorem prover

Slate is an interactive theorem prover that is currently under development.
This repository contains its standard library.

## Web access

Slate is designed as a web application; the entire library can be edited using the web interface at http://www.slate-prover.org/.

The web interface automatically creates personal forks of this repository for each contributor, and sends submissions as pull requests.

## Local development

For more complex tasks, we recommend the [extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sreichelt.slate). Please follow the instructions on that page.

The [Slate repository](https://github.com/SReichelt/slate) contains the library as a Git submodule. To upload local changes, you will need to add your own fork as a Git remote for this submodule.
